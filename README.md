# Face Detection Web App

This is an open-source web application for real-time face detection, powered by TensorFlow.js. It utilizes on-device machine learning, enabling fast and efficient face detection directly within the user's web browser.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using TensorFlow.js.
- On-device machine learning for fast and efficient processing without requiring server-side computation.
- User-friendly web interface for easy interaction.
- Customizable face detection settings for sensitivity, minimum face size, etc.
- Support for webcam input for real-time face detection.
- Scalable and lightweight design for smooth performance across various devices.
- Security measures implemented to protect user data and ensure privacy.
- Integration-ready API for easy incorporation into other projects or applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with the face detection web app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Pranavv2006/Face-Expression-App.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Face-Expression-App


3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

4. Allow access to your webcam if prompted, and you're ready to use the face detection web app!

## Usage

- Upload an image or enable your webcam to start real-time face detection.
- Adjust the face detection settings as needed to customize the detection parameters.
- Experiment with different lighting conditions, orientations, and facial expressions to test the accuracy and robustness of the face detection algorithm.
